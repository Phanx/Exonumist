Exonumist
============

Adds currency counts for all of your characters in currency tooltips.

For example, tooltips for Justice Points will show you how many Justice
Points each of your characters on the same realm and faction has.

There are no options; it “just works”. You must log into a character
at least once with Exonumist enabled before information about that
character’s currency tokens will appear in the tooltips. Data for
characters not seen in the last 30 days is removed automatically.

Feedback

**Post a comment on WoWInterface.** If you are reporting a bug, please
include detailed instructions I can follow to reproduce the bug myself,
whether or not it still happens when all other addons are disabled, and
the exact text of the first related error message (if any) from BugSack.

Please note that I consider this addon to be complete, and will probably
not add any new features. If you notice any currency tooltips missing
information, please post a comment explaining what you clicked on or
moused over to get the tooltip, and which type of currency is involved.

If you need to contact me privately, you can send a private message to
Phanx on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>.
**Please note** that I do not provide private addon support or tutoring
of any kind; post a comment or forum thread instead!
