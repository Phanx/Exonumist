Exonumist
============

Adds currency counts for all of your characters in currency tooltips.

For example, tooltips for Justice Points will show you how many Justice
Points each of your characters on the same realm and faction has.

There are no options; it “just works”. You must log into a character
at least once with Exonumist enabled before information about that
character’s currency tokens will appear in the tooltips. Data for
characters not seen in the last 30 days is removed automatically.
