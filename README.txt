Exonumist
============

Adds currency counts for all of your characters in currency tooltips.

For example, when you see a tooltip for Justice Points, you'll see how many Justice Points you have on all of your characters on the same realm and faction.

There are no options; it “just works”. You must log into a character at least once with Exonumist enabled before information about that character’s currency tokens will appear in the tooltips. Data for characters not seen in the last 30 days is removed automatically.
